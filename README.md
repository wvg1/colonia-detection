# Multi-State Colonia Detection Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning
This exploratory project is intended to detect informal housing settlements (colonias) near the US-Mexico border using freely available satellite imagery and machine learning.

# Overview
Colonias are unincorporated residential communities clustered throughout the southwestern United States, often lacking basic infrastructure like paved roads and sewers. This project uses satellite remote sensing data and machine learning to automatically identify colonias across Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. More accurate detection could potentially surface previously undocumented communities and enable better resource targeting in these communities.

# RQs
- Can we reliably detect colonias using freely available satellite data (Sentinel-2)?
- Do detection models generalize across different border states and geographies?
- What are the key spectral and spatial features that distinguish colonias from other settlement types?
- Where does an ML-based approach fail, and what does that reveal about the problem?
